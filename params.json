Bumpy Editor\r\n\r\nThis was an editor for the game Bumpy. The original game can be downloaded at the [World of Spectrum page](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000763).\r\n\r\nThere is also a [youtube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bhL1p1bERI) of the game, to see how it works.\r\n\r\nMy editor allows you to create your own levels for the game. I originally wrote it hoping to get it published in Your Sinclair, but it went out of circulation shortly after writing the program, so I never ended up sending it to them. For those interested in Your Sinclair, see this [memorial site](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/).\r\n\r\n* [Editor Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petemoore/zxspectrum/master/BumpyEditor/BumpyEditor.tzx)\r\n* [Original game Download](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000763)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Main Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petemoore/zxspectrum/master/BumpyEditor/MainMenu.png)  \r\n![Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petemoore/zxspectrum/master/BumpyEditor/Editor.png)   \r\n![Element Selector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petemoore/zxspectrum/master/BumpyEditor/ElementSelector.png)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
