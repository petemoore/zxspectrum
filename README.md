# 1. Bumpy Editor

This was an editor for the game Bumpy. The original game can be downloaded at the [World of Spectrum page](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000763).

There is also a [youtube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bhL1p1bERI) of the game, to see how it works.

My editor allows you to create your own levels for the game. I originally wrote it hoping to get it published in Your Sinclair, but it went out of circulation shortly after writing the program, so I never ended up sending it to them. For those interested in Your Sinclair, see this [memorial site](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/).
